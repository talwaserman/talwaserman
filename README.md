- I'm a Teach Lead FrontEnd developer, working at eBay.
- In the past 7 years i worked for several tech companies as a fullstack and frontend developer.
- I'm always working on something new and exiting while trying to focuse on web development, UX, performance and architecture of client apps.
- Fun fact: I love creating POCs just to prove that what i imagin can be done.
